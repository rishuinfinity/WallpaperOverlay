## Motivation

I have a habit to change my wallpaper more frequently. And there were some problems I faced on a regular basis:

- I needed to change my dock colour everytime I change my wallpaper so that It may feel consistent with the wallpaper.
- If my dock was transparent then for some wallpapers the color of dock area was so light that the text were barely visible.
- Adding a solid color to dock sometimes gave the feeling that the dock and wallpaper are two separate entities and if I put gradient on the dock then the gradient looked weird as it ranged on the very short heighted dock.
- I made this extension to solve these problems, but while in the making, I realised that It has some potential. Like I can imagine a large set of several innovative overlays which make the Desktop experience more pleasing.

## Features

This extension has following features:

- Visit [Wallpaper Overlay Collection](https://rishuinfinity.github.io/wallpaper-overlays-collection/) to download more custom overlay designs or contribute yours.
- Apply an overlay on wallpaper in four easy steps
  - Choose image : Either take the currently set wallpaper or choose it manually through the file picker
  - Choose overlay : Either choose it from the default drop-down or select a custom svg/png overlay
  - Choose color : Each svg overlay can have one colour that can be modified to the colour you choose here.
  - Click apply and the overlay will be applied and wallpaper will be set.
- You can even apply multiple overlays by:
  - Apply one overlay
  - Reselect current set wallpaper
  - Apply second overlay and so on.
- You can set it to automatically apply your selected overlay whenever wallpaper is changed.
- This extension is also compatible with [Wallpaper Switcher](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4812/wallpaper-switcher/) hence it gives a much more smooth experience when using Wallpaper Overlay and Wallpaper Switcher together.

## Overlay Creating Guide

You can create an overlay with your ideas preety easily

- I recommend to copy any overlay file from /src/resources or from [Wallpaper Overlays collection](https://rishuinfinity.github.io/wallpaper-overlays-collection/). Then edit it in any svg editor like inkscape.
- If you want to have the option to change one color, you can set the changeable color to #0000ff. This color in the whole svg gets replaced while applying overlay.
- You can even create a transparent png to use as an overlay.
